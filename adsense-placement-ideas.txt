AdSense Placement Notes
=======================

Global Shell
- Insert a responsive leaderboard just below the InfoBar and before <main> in src/app/RootLayout.tsx so every route inherits a high-visibility unit without crowding navigation.
- Consider an optional sticky sidebar or footer anchor that appears before <Footer /> for wide screens while reserving height to avoid layout shift.

Landing Page
- Keep the hero area clean for messaging; focus monetization on units that appear after the feature grid.
- Add a native in-feed unit after the second row of feature cards so it blends with navigation cards.

Optimizer Input Page
- Keep the form above the fold; append a responsive rectangle beneath the form button row in src/features/optimizer/pages/OptimizerPage.tsx.
- Optionally add a matched-content style card under the feature description for returning visitors.

Optimizer Results Page
- Position a medium rectangle below the KPI masthead but before the Recommended Upgrades card in src/features/optimizer/pages/OptimizerResultPage.tsx.
- Inside the results card, add an in-article unit between <Paperdoll /> and <NarrativePlan />, and consider breaking long narrative sections with ads after every three to four upgrade steps.

Rewards Page
- Use the gaps between major sections in src/features/rewards/pages/RewardsPage.tsx for 336x280 or responsive blocks, especially after <VaultCards /> and before the raid cards.

Guides Index
- Place a horizontal unit between the class selector card and <GuideGrid /> in src/features/guides/pages/GuidesIndexPage.tsx.
- Inject a native-style ad inside the grid after every second guide card via a placeholder component.

Guide Articles
- Reserve space between the hero image and the article body for a top-of-article leaderboard in src/features/guides/pages/GuidePostPage.tsx.
- Insert in-article ads inside renderBlocks after the first paragraph and every four blocks to mimic Auto ads while avoiding adjacent calls to action.

Informational Pages (FAQ, Terms, Privacy)
- If these pages gain more content, place a single auto ad after the first section (src/features/faq/pages/FaqPage.tsx, legal pages) while keeping density low.

Implementation Notes
- Load AdSense with a consent-aware wrapper, use data-ad-format="auto" with explicit min-heights to prevent layout shift, and lazy-load below-the-fold units.
- Throttle ad count per page (for example, three on results, two on landing) to preserve performance and stay within policy.

Implementation Summary
- Added `GoogleAd` component handling AdSense script loading, pushing display calls, and rendering placeholders when `VITE_ADSENSE_CLIENT` is absent.
- Stored slot identifiers in `src/config/ads.ts` for reuse across pages.
- Injected ad containers into RootLayout (top/footer), Landing grid, Optimizer form/results, Rewards sections, Guides index, and Guide post pages.
- Documented setup steps in README (set `VITE_ADSENSE_CLIENT`, update slot ids, dev-only placeholders).
