What GearForge does
-------------------

-   **Reads your character** from a SimC export (no login needed).

-   **Shows your current gear** in a calm, WoW-style paperdoll.

-   **Highlights upgrade targets** with clear "upgrade to ilvl X" pills.

-   **Adds a step-by-step plan** that tells you *what to upgrade first* and *which crests you'll spend*.

-   **Shares a link** you can copy to revisit or send to friends.

Everything is fast, local, and privacy-friendly.

How to use it
-------------

1.  **In game:** type `/simc` (SimulationCraft addon) and copy the text.\
    *(Any SimC export string works.)*

2.  **Open GearForge** and paste the text. Click **Analyze**.

3.  **Read the plan:** Use the "Copy Link" button to save or share.

That's it.

What you'll see
---------------

### Paperdoll

A two-column layout that mirrors the in-game character pane.\
Each slot shows:

-   **Item name** tinted by rarity

-   **Right-side ilvl pill**: your current ilvl, or the **new ilvl** if we recommend an upgrade

-   A small note if the item is **crafted** (no crest upgrades)

### Recommended upgrades

Rows with a gold accent show items where spending crests is worth it.\
You'll see:

-   A **gold "Upgrade: A â†’ B" pill** under the item name

-   The **target ilvl** on the right pill (so you know where you'll land)

### Upgrade plan (checklist)

A short, ordered list that explains *why* each step is suggested.\
Reasons include:

-   **Ceiling breaker** -- pushes the slot above your natural drop ceiling

-   **Best value** -- highest item-level per crest spent

-   **Biggest gain** -- the largest single-slot ilvl jump

-   **No crests** -- purely flightstones or already capped

You'll also see compact **crest totals** so you can tell if you have enough for the session.

* * * * *

Crest tiers we show
-------------------

-   **Weathered**

-   **Carved**

-   **Runed**

-   **Gilded**

Flightstones are supported for planning but aren't counted in crest totals (they're easy to earn and usually not the blocker).

* * * * *

Supported content
-----------------

-   Tuned for **The War Within -- Season 3** tracks and ranks.

-   Fully models **Veteran / Champion / Hero / Myth** upgrades.\
    Lower tracks are detected from item level and shown appropriately.

If Blizzard changes the upgrade system, we update the season config and you're good to go.

* * * * *

Privacy & data
--------------

-   Your SimC text is **parsed in your browser**.

-   We don't store your character data on our servers.

-   Item icons are fetched from Blizzard's public Media API; responses are cached.

* * * * *

Known limits (so you're not surprised)
--------------------------------------

-   **Crafted items**: we show them, but they don't use the crest upgrade track.

-   **Performance sims**: GearForge focuses on **upgrade paths & costs**, not DPS sims.

-   **Flightstones**: shown in steps when relevant, but not included in crest totals.

-   **"Best" is contextual**: recommendations assume you want to push ilvl efficiently within the current season's rules.

* * * * *

Tips
----

-   If icons load a moment later, that's just Blizzard's image CDN---content is ready immediately.

-   Use **Copy Link** to keep a snapshot of your current plan.

-   Your **drop ceiling** (natural loot level from your content) matters: upgrades above that line help the most.
